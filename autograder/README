COMP 412, Fall 2023

The lab2 autograder / autotimer is similar to the equivalent tools from lab1.

TO MAKE THIS WORK IN YOUR DIRECTORY:

1. Unpack the tar file. It will create a directory l2ag.

2. Edit auto_grade/auto_grade.py and change the setting of the
   variable "base_name" so that it has the path name to the directory
   containing the RunGrader script.  "base_dir" must end in a slash ("/").

3. Edit auto_time/auto_time.py and change the setting of the
   variable "base_name" so that it has the path name to the directory
   containing the RunGrader script.  "base_name" must end in a slash ("/").

4. To run the autograder, place your tar archive file in the directory
   TarFileGoesHere. Then, invoke the script "./Grader".  Results are
   written into a log file whose name begins with "Timer-" and into 
   the file "./results/Score.txt".

   The autograder performs a quick estimation of scalability. For more
   accurate results, use the autotimer.

5. To run the autotimer, place your tar archive file in the directory
   TarFileGoesHere. Then, invoke the script "./Timer".  Results are 
   written into a log file whose name begins with "Grader-" and into
   the file "./results/TimerResults.txt

   If you want to increase the number of trials that the autotimer makes
   at each size, change the setting of the variable NumberOfTrials in 
   auto_time/auto_time.py. WARNING: This change may make a difference on 
   a small scale. If your lab is running over 20 seconds, the problem is 
   not with the number of trials.  In this situation, don't increase the
   number of trials as it will just increase the workload on the system.

The files in the results directory are tab-separated and suitable for importing
into your favorite spreadsheet program.

The blocks for the autograder can be found in auto_grade/blocks/. The blocks
in the distributed autograder constitute about half of the blocks that we 
will use when we grade your final submission.

-------------------------------
If you include multiple tar archives, each will be scored.
The "comp412" tar file uses lab2_ref.
