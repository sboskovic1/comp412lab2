COMP 412, Fall 2023

The lab2 autograder / autotimer is similar to the equivalent tools from lab1.

TO MAKE THIS WORK IN YOUR DIRECTORY:

1. Unpack the tar file. It will create a directory l2ag.
2. Go into the l2ag/auto_grade directory.
3. Edit auto_grade.py and change the setting of the variable "base_dir" 
   so that it has the path name to the directory containing the RunGrader
   script.  "base_dir" must end in a slash ("/").

4. To run the autograder, place your tar archive file in the directory
   TarFileGoesHere. Then, invoke the script "./Grader".  Results are
   written into a log file whose name begins with "Timer-" and into 
   the file "./results/Score.txt".

5. To run the autotimer, place your tar archive file in the directory
   TarFileGoesHere. Then, invoke the script "./Timer".  Results are 
   written into a log file whose name begins with "Grader-" and into
   the file "./results/TimerResults.txt"

The files in the results directory are tab-separated and suitable for importing
into your favorite spreadsheet program.

-------------------------------
If you include multiple tar archives, each will be scored.
The "comp412" tar file in DefaultTarFiles/ uses lab2_ref.
